Documentation (to be done):

- To simulate finer meshes use smaller dt's (it's faster)
- In makeMovie adjust to the refresh rate of your device
- To simulate complex grasps, control more than one adjacent point, but you must have positive shr > 0 and str > 0,
else there will be l.d. gradients and (close to) singular matrices.
